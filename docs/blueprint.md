We are developing a comprehensive salon services and product booking application tailored specifically for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), with cultural and religious alignment at its core. The platform—branded with an attractive Arabic name and logo (to be finalized)—will offer a luxurious and intuitive bilingual experience in both Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR), designed especially for Arabic-speaking women, families, and culturally observant men. With a visually appealing and culturally respectful UI/UX that resonates with Saudi ladies, the system prioritizes privacy, gender segregation (ladies-only and hijab-friendly filters), and Islamic values. The platform supports salon owners in publishing services and managing bookings, discounts, and customer engagement, while customers can browse salons, book services, earn rewards, and enjoy in-home and VIP services. Features include real-time booking management, loyalty programs, online and offline payments (including Mada), and a dynamic pricing model. The app will showcase 5 real salons from Al-Ahsa and profiles of 5 renowned regional beauticians (face-free images), with high-quality visuals of interiors, tools, and services. A PWA-ready frontend with Material Design, elegant animations, colorful icons for 10+ beauty services, and pricing in Saudi Riyals (﷼) ensures a premium look and feel. Both salon owners and admins will access dashboards for analytics, income tracking, and customer management. The platform is built with scalability in mind, with future-ready plans for Android and iOS apps, ensuring privacy, cultural respect, and convenience are never compromised.
